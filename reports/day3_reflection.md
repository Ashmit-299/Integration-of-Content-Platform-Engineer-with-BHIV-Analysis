# Day 3 Reflection - BHIV LM Client + Feedback Loop

## Honesty
Where placeholder LM diverges from expected BHIV LM output: The current fallback implementation uses simple keyword matching and rule-based suggestions, while the actual BHIV LM would provide contextual understanding, semantic analysis, and personalized improvement recommendations based on user behavior patterns and content effectiveness metrics.

## Gratitude
Credits to LLM prompt design resources: The FastAPI documentation and async/await patterns in Python were essential for building the LM client interface. The httpx library provided excellent async HTTP client capabilities for future LM API integration.

## Integrity
Logged exact feedback payload used for `improve_storyboard()` in `bucket/logs/feedback_<video_id>.json`. This includes the raw rating (1-5), user comment text, timestamp, video ID, and the complete analysis response. No data is modified or sanitized before logging to ensure complete audit trail.

## Achievements  
- ✅ Created `bhiv_lm_client.py` with async LM interface
- ✅ Implemented fallback heuristics when BHIV LM unavailable
- ✅ Wired `/rate` endpoint to trigger improvement suggestions
- ✅ Added comprehensive feedback logging system
- ✅ Built `suggest_storyboard()` and `improve_storyboard()` functions
- ✅ Integrated AI feedback loop with bucket storage
