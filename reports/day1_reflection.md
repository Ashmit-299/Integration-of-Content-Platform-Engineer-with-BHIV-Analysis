# Day 1 Reflection - BHIV Bucket (Storage Abstraction)

## Honesty
One behavior still done manually: The storyboard generation still uses simple heuristic text splitting rather than semantic understanding. The `split_into_scenes()` function in `video/storyboard.py` relies on sentence counting and basic keyword detection rather than understanding content structure.

## Gratitude  
The Python `pathlib` module and `shutil` library were invaluable for creating clean, cross-platform file operations. The existing project structure provided a solid foundation to build upon.

## Integrity
Saved one failing test case in `bucket/tmp/` - when processing empty or malformed script files, the system should gracefully handle the error rather than crashing. This edge case needs proper validation and error handling in the bucket abstraction layer.

## Achievements
- ✅ Created `bhiv_bucket.py` with proper storage abstraction
- ✅ Implemented bucket structure: scripts/, storyboards/, videos/, logs/, ratings/, tmp/
- ✅ Updated server.py to use bucket functions
- ✅ All storage operations now go through centralized bucket interface
- ✅ Environment variable support for bucket path configuration
