# Day 2 Reflection - BHIV Core (Orchestrator)

## Honesty
Failure modes that need retries: FFmpeg video rendering can fail due to codec issues, temporary file locks, or insufficient disk space. The current implementation doesn't have retry logic for these transient failures. Network timeouts during file operations also need proper retry mechanisms.

## Gratitude
The `bhiv_bucket` pattern saved significant time by providing a clean abstraction layer. Instead of scattered file operations throughout the codebase, having centralized `save_script()`, `save_storyboard()`, and `save_video()` functions made the orchestrator implementation much cleaner and more maintainable.

## Integrity  
Saved raw failed job metadata in `bucket/logs/<id>.json` for all processing failures. This includes the original script content, error messages, stack traces, and timestamps. This data will be crucial for debugging and improving the system reliability.

## Achievements
- ✅ Built `bhiv_core.py` with `process_script_upload()` orchestrator
- ✅ Centralized all video generation workflow in single service layer
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Created `/ingest/webhook` endpoint for external integrations
- ✅ Replaced direct file operations with orchestrator calls
- ✅ Implemented job metadata tracking in bucket/logs/
